# Web Scraping Example

This is a simple example of web scraping using Python and BeautifulSoup. It demonstrates how to extract specific elements from a webpage and print the extracted data.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `requests` library
- `beautifulsoup4` library

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the code files.
2. Install the required libraries by running the following command:

   ```shell
   pip install requests beautifulsoup4
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the Python script file `web_scraping_example.py`.
2. Modify the `url` variable to the target website's URL that you want to scrape.
3. Run the script using the following command:

   ```shell
   python web_scraping.py
   ```

## Output

The script will print the following information:

- Title of the webpage.
- Text content of all the paragraphs (`<p>` elements) found on the webpage.

## Customization

You can customize the script to scrape other elements or extract additional data based on the HTML structure of the target website. Refer to the BeautifulSoup documentation for more details on its methods and capabilities.

## Legal and Ethical Considerations

Please ensure that you comply with the terms of service of the website you are scraping and adhere to any legal or ethical guidelines. Be respectful of the website's resources and avoid overwhelming their servers with excessive requests.

## Update Notes

`Version 1.1`

In this updated code:
- **Error Handling**: The code is wrapped in try-except blocks to handle potential exceptions during the request and parsing processes. If an error occurs, an appropriate error message is printed, and the program exits with a non-zero status code.
- **User-Agent**: A custom User-Agent header is included in the request to mimic a web browser and enhance compatibility with websites that may block or limit scraping bots.
- **Robust Element Selection**: Instead of using find() and find_all(), the code now uses select_one() and select() methods with CSS selectors. This provides more robust element selection capabilities. The title is selected using soup.select_one('title'), and paragraphs are selected using soup.select('p').
- These changes help improve the code's reliability and adaptability to different scenarios. Remember to customize the User-Agent string to suit your needs and comply with the website's terms of service.
